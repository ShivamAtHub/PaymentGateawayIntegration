## Description
- This is a Web Development project for The Sparks Foundation GRIP Internship of April 2023.
- The website in this project is also Responsive, it means it can run on any browser and also it is mobile/tablet compatible.
- This project includes only one `main.html` file.
- I also have included all the images used in this project. (you can change them according to your preference)

## Requirements
- This project can be edited on any IDE, I created it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- This project was made with the help of HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS.
- You will not need anything else.
- This project can run on any browser. (Chrome preferred)

## How_To_Run
- Download my repository and place it anywhere on your computer.
- Open the `main.html` file present.
- On the Home Page you can use the `Navbbar` or the body.
- If you click on `Home` on the top it will take you to the main body of the page.
- If you click on `About-us`, it will take you to the About-us section of the page.
- Now the main step, click on any of the two `Donate Now` buttons, either on the NavBar or the Body of the page.
- It will take you to a Payment Gateaway (which is in test mode so no real transaction will be implemented).
- Select any amount between ₹1 - ₹100 and click on Next.
- Enter your email (make sure to enter correct email to get the invoice), enter your phone number (since we are on test mode you can enter a dummy phone number of 10 digits), enter your Name & finally click on `Proceed to Pay`.

- (Note- At any step in the payment gateway you can click on the `x` on the top right and cancel the payment)
- It will process your transaction and your Payment will be successfull.
